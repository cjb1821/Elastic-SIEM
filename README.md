  ◦ Set up and configured an Elastic SIEM in a home lab environment, configured elastic agents for log collection, and forwarded data to the SIEM for monitoring

  ◦ Generated and analyzed security events on the SIEM and collected log data by using Nmap and doing other probing activities on a Kali Linux VM 

  ◦ Created a custom dashboard in the Elastic SIEM to visualize security events and demonstrated skills in interpreting data and pattern recognition. Created and tested alert rules to detect specific events.
